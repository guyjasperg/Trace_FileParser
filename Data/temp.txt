1
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,730
Oh.

2
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,760
You are conscious now.

3
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,937
Thank God. I thought you are dead.

4
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,730
S...sit tight.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,626
You know...

6
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,560
Maybe you broke something.

7
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,560
Don't move.

8
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Where am I?

9
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,030
Why am I...

10
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,210
Listen, sir.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,410
I've already called emergency.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
They are coming.

13
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,660
So...

14
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,450
I am leaving.

15
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,900
Good luck.

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,540
Sir.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,850
You are saying,

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,586
that you don't remember who you are?

19
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
And no ID?

20
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,550
Your car

21
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,926
was towed to Wonchang
junkyard in Ulsan.

22
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,310
Take my card.

23
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,350
The car is registered to Kang I-an.

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,100
This is not you?

25
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,850
Doctor said

26
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,663
you have a gunshot wound
in your shoulder.

27
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
You don't remember this?

28
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,196
If it's really a gunshot wound,

29
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,186
you need to report it to the police

30
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,970
and clear all details.

31
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,050
I asked for a room, we can talk there.

32
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,080
Wait a bit.

33
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,850
Ok.

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,100
Maybe we should contact
criminal department?

35
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,310
Ji Cheol-ho...

36
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,590
Ji Cheol-ho...

37
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,616
Make sure to check it.

38
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's talk at home.

39
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,680
What is it?

40
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,650
You don't feel good?

41
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,640
What's wrong?

42
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,970
What is it with him?

43
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,430
Is he crazy?

44
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,960
What is it?

45
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
This is a dream...

46
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,250
How come?

47
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,800
Why so?

48
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,100
What the...

49
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
What is happening?

50
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
I...

51
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,890
I...

52
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,066
How many times do I need to tell,
that it was not me?

53
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,023
I told you, I don't remember.

54
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,120
What are you talking about?

55
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,150
Why would I do it?

56
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,156
Hey.

57
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,016
When I opened my eyes,
I was already at home.

58
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,036
I'm coming to you.

59
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,996
Let's meet.

60
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,556
Hello?

61
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,940
Are you really...

62
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,970
Wait...

63
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,200
Hold on!

64
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,430
Wait...

65
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,610
I'm not...

66
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,660
Ah, wait!

67
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Get in!

68
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:23,000
SPIRITWALKER

69
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,520
ID. Lee Shin-woo.

70
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,266
Delivery New World.
Chief Lee Shin-woo.

71
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,440
Shin-woo?

72
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,010
Chief.

73
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
Chief Lee Shin-woo?

74
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
You won't go inside?

75
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,640
Chief Lee!

76
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,260
What is it with him?

77
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,020
Where is he going?

78
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,050
This will nobody buy from you!

79
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,750
Let's not bring useless stuff!

80
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,746
It is not useless!

81
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,586
Have a look!

82
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,910
I just want to eat pancake.

83
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,050
Ah?

84
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,346
It is so delicious when it's hot...

85
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,266
Then.

86
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,970
Here is 1000 won for you.

87
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,856
Take it.

88
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Thousand?

89
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,620
Are you kidding?

90
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't want?

91
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,360
Shithead.

92
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,046
Took everything for himself, shithead.

93
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,246
Don't buy alcohol!

94
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,270
I won't!

95
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,570
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,650
You startled me.

97
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,740
Is it not rude to take someone's seat?

98
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Oh God.

99
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,230
Human life is priceless.

100
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,290
Why spend it for this?

101
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Sir.

102
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,406
Do you remember the man who had
a car accident today in the morning?

103
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,640
178cm tall.

104
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,180
About 80kg weight?

105
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,740
It was me.

106
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,920
But suddenly

107
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,830
I became like this.

108
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
What?

109
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,750
The body changed.

110
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,380
Bullshit, right?

111
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,066
You know,

112
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,020
I don't quiet understand
what you mean.

113
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,687
I don't know which one of them is me.

114
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,440
I don't remember anything.

115
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,486
I know where is Seoul

116
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,150
and where is Gwanghwamun station.

117
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,660
But who I am, I don't know.

118
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,270
I think, I know.

119
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,286
It's written here.

120
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,577
"Delivery New World. Lee Shin-woo"

121
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,200
This man is not me.

122
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,680
Then who is he?

123
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,920
This man.

124
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,146
Lee Shin-woo?

125
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,170
Yes?

126
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,606
You see, you are Lee Shin-woo.

127
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,116
I am not Lee Shin-woo.

128
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,400
Then who is he?

129
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,470
This man.

130
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,896
And you are not Lee Shin-woo?

131
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,586
No.

132
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,726
And where is he?

133
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750
Right here.

134
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,896
This man is Lee Shin-woo?

135
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,196
Yes this man is Lee Shin-woo.

136
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,580
Then who are you?

137
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,910
I...

138
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,066
Today in the morning you
wore a brown coat,

139
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,756
a cap with Spider-Man,

140
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,050
a green scarf

141
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,640
and gloves.

142
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,683
And you called the emergency.

143
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,740
Then...

144
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,846
that man in the morning didn't die,

145
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,120
and now he is in that body?

146
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,380
No.

147
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,230
He was fine.

148
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,096
But honestly don't know,
how he is now.

149
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,130
Then

150
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
it's Lee Shin-woo who is dead?

151
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,836
No.

152
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,046
Then who is dead?

153
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,210
Nobody died!

154
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,910
Both didn't die.

155
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,690
And both are not me!

156
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,720
How do you know this?

157
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
What?

158
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,296
You we saying, you
don't know who you are.

159
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,920
So how can you know, that it's not you?

160
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,530
Indeed.

161
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,210
How can I know?

162
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,446
Sir.

163
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,470
Sir!

164
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,100
Which one do you want most?

165
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,706
What?

166
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,546
Choose one.

167
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,090
Will give for free.

168
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,626
I don't want to eat it.

169
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,626
Why you don't want?

170
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,960
I see, you are staring at hotdog!

171
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,590
You like it more than doughnut
or rice pancake.

172
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
See.

173
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,510
You exist.

174
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,060
And you like it.

175
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes?

176
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,270
And I like more

177
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,980
this doughnut.

178
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,050
Oh.

179
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,280
Everyone has that period of life.

180
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,630
All these people

181
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,610
don't know who they are.

182
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,360
But this is not important.

183
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,256
In our life

184
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,186
more important is where you are from

185
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,546
and where you are heading to.

186
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,250
So where are you from?

187
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,740
You don't know?

188
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,036
If you don't know,
then go to the beginning.

189
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,460
That way you will find out
where you are heading to.

190
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,040
What is it?

191
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,610
Hey.

192
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,146
What is it?

193
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,210
Why did you help Kang I-an?!

194
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,516
Remember something?

195
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,746
How many times to repeat?!

196
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,030
Go back to the very beginning.

197
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,226
To the very beginning.

198
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,410
Yes, right.

199
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,880
There are many people,
who don't remember their past.

200
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,170
Kang I-an is really...

201
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,750
So you will continue that way?

202
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,746
You don't believe?

203
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,986
You don't believe me?!

204
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,570
It was not me!

205
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,090
Not me!

206
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,556
I was doing everything,
what was ordered!

207
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,406
Let go!

208
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,386
Let go, damn!

209
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,460
Let go!

210
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,890
Wait!

211
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,700
You shithead!

212
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,520
Where am I?

213
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
Who are you?

214
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,530
What?

215
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,063
You went back so far to the beginning?

216
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,490
I

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,080
will leave for a moment.

218
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,456
Hey!

219
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,900
Wait!

220
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,700
What is it?

221
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,030
Soon-Young, what is it?

222
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,470
We will...

223
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,726
Wait.

224
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,456
Just listen...

225
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,960
I think, somebody got inside.

226
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,606
Then who? I put a sign.

227
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,310
Somebody opened the door!

228
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,070
Is there someone?

229
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,766
Nobody is there!

230
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,100
Sure there is!

231
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,130
Look!

232
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,496
Why are you doing this to me?

233
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,800
Won't come out?!

234
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,740
You didn't see the sign...

235
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,530
Excuse me.

236
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,800
We are...

237
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,160
We are on business her.

238
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,360
She just drank too much,
so she felt sick.

239
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,923
This is not, what you are thinking.

240
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,360
It changed again.

241
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,990
During the day.

242
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,480
And during the night.

243
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,960
And during the night...

244
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,180
12 o'clock.

245
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,200
Calm down.

246
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,650
Go back to the beginning.

247
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,640
Yes.

248
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,070
To the beginning.

249
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,410
Junkyard Wonchang.

250
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,610
Let's talk at home.

251
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,160
"All this evil is coming from
inside and corrupting the man", God says.

252
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,910
God says.

253
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,790
Praise God.

254
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,660
Praise God.

255
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,410
Dear brothers and sisters,

256
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,480
let's pray for the peace.

257
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,730
Don't move.

258
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,100
Looking for me?

259
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,560
Kill.

260
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,266
I don't know what...

261
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,680
Don't move.

262
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,600
Where is Kang?

263
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,840
Listen to me.

264
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,486
I am not the one,
who you are seeing...

265
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,030
Where is Kang I-an?

266
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,880
Who are you talking about?
I don't know.

267
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
I will count to three.

268
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,090
Who are you?

269
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,110
One.

270
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,910
I think I know you.

271
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,280
Explain to me.

272
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,576
How do you know me?

273
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,630
Who are you?

274
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,386
Two.

275
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,186
Photo.

276
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,520
I have a photo.

277
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,566
I brought it from that car.

278
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,796
I was inside it.

279
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,586
Three.

280
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,810
Wait.

281
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,430
Wait.

282
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,150
I really, really don't know anything.

283
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,740
Tell me, where he is.

284
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,390
Really.

285
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,923
Oh... how did I do that...

286
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,450
One moment.

287
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,106
Relax.

288
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,200
Calm down.

289
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
This is

290
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,410
you, right?

291
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,810
What are you doing there?

292
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,580
You know me, right?

293
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,610
Who am I?

294
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,976
What?

295
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,280
What am I doi...

296
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,580
What am I doing?

297
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,970
Excuse me, I took the wrong seat.

298
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
I have to go, I'm leaving.

299
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
Wait.

300
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
Then maybe

301
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,990
you know her?

302
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,850
No, I have no idea.

303
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,790
Then who is that man,
who you met in the toilet?

304
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,170
Where did he go?

305
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,346
And who were those men in the warehouse?

306
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,920
Go Joong-sa?

307
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,996
Yes.

308
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,906
Go Jongsma.

309
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,290
Where is he?

310
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,680
Yes.

311
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,040
I think here.

312
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,640
Yes.

313
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,960
Here?

314
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,910
Yes, he says to go to the second floor.

315
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,440
I don't know, I'm scared.

316
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,620
Ok bye, he is coming up.

317
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,050
Are you here?

318
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,066
You don't have to be here.

319
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,610
What are you doing?

320
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,306
We have already set up the scene.

321
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,720
And the legend.

322
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,796
Recently a woman pointed a gun at me.

323
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,416
Short hair, about 167cm tall.

324
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,136
Double eyelid, several moles on the left.

325
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,086
In her 20's.

326
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,986
You are talking about Moon Jin-ah?

327
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,836
Moon Jin-ah?

328
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,660
Moles on the left you said?

329
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,980
Is it her?

330
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,856
I think yes, Moon Jin-ah.

331
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,246
What relationship do you have with her?

332
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,310
Relationship?

333
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,060
We didn't have any.

334
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,090
Ah no.

335
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,666
So.

336
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,370
Do you know her address?

337
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,070
One moment.

338
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,136
Kahwedong district, 11,

339
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,760
house 27.

340
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,000
Apartment 102.

341
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
One month passed already.

342
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,870
Hey, who am I talking to?

343
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,560
Kahwedong, 11, house 27...

344
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,366
Ah?

345
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,106
Kahwedong, 11...

346
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,810
What's wrong with him?

347
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
What is it?

348
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,840
Are you ok?

349
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,088
Kahwedong district, 11, house 27.
Apartment 102.

350
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,210
NOAH MOOLSAN

351
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,230
DELIVERY "NEW WORLD"

352
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,580
Kahwedong, 11, house 27...

353
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,760
11-27...

354
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,010
Namyang highway, 37 minutes ago.

355
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,076
What do you think,

356
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
who is it?

357
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,306
Manager Park Joon-Young, right?

358
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,930
Is he really wanted?

359
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,656
How long will you let it go?

360
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,147
Till he leaks all inside information?

361
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,230
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,466
I will immediately
track his location and...

363
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,930
Are you a parrot?!

364
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,426
It is already a week that you
try to "immediately" track his location!

365
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,990
What about Kang I-an?

366
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,266
He was 48 hours late with his report.

367
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,546
It's early yet to say, that he
is connected to manager Yoo.

368
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,830
In this case not early.

369
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,316
You will put yourself together,
when you will get fired?

370
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,476
And the responsible is not coming.

371
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,780
We need to gather them all.

372
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,530
He is coming at last, dumbass.

373
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,700
ID. Kang I-an.

374
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,100
Kang I-an.

375
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,376
Could you reach Kang I-an?

376
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,066
He is the best agent in our team.

377
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,290
You know, that this is difficult.

378
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,040
Bride?

379
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,727
Her phone was switched off the same day.

380
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,800
First we reported her
missing to the police.

381
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,332
But if the chief agrees,
I will start looking for her.

382
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,450
After we catch manager Yoo.

383
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,810
Don't rush.

384
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,156
If the news will get to the
head office like the last time,

385
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,650
we will all get problems.

386
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,688
Manager Yoo, Moon Jin-ah and Kang I-an
disappeared at the same time.

387
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,790
I think we should hurry.

388
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,270
First find manager Yoo.

389
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,400
Got it.

390
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,942
Kang I-an, the girl from the church,
Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo,

391
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,610
Noah Moolsan...

392
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,670
Kang I-an

393
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,950
Everybody knows Kang I-an.

394
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,310
Kang I-an.

395
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,840
Kang I-an...

396
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,770
Where is Kang I-an?

397
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,450
Hold on.

398
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,770
Where are you leaving?

399
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,310
Come with me.

400
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,350
Calm down.

401
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,810
Ah shit...

402
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,090
You will get hurt.

403
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,056
Where are you going?

404
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Shit.

405
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,840
This car. Get in faster.

406
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,280
Moon Jin-ah!

407
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,740
Hurry, get in!

408
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,100
Hold on.

409
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,220
Manager Yoo!

410
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,900
Fucking shithead!

411
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,960
Where is I-an?

412
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,690
Wait...

413
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,680
Where is I-an?

414
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,120
I want to know it too.

415
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,776
When I came back that day,

416
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,260
there was nobody.

417
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,946
They are also looking for I-an.

418
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,346
So have has to be alive.

419
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,730
So that I-an...

420
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
He is immobilized,

421
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,946
so he has to be treated somewhere.

422
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,970
Hold tight!

423
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,956
Listen.

424
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,956
It will be hard to understand.

425
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,066
But listen to me.

426
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,326
Something strange is happening to me.

427
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,076
First, I'm not the person,
who you see now.

428
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,936
I'm in a different body now.

429
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,366
But the bodies always change.

430
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:55,996
Twice a day.

431
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,556
At midnight and midday.

432
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,646
Always changing to someone different.

433
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,166
What are you talking about?

434
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,056
In the church today it was also me.

435
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,106
You were threatening me with a gun.

436
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,390
Who is real me?

437
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,436
What is happening?

438
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,036
I don't remember anything about it!

439
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,850
I don't know, why this is happening!

440
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,990
But I think, I am that man.

441
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,310
That man?

442
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,600
Kang I-an.

443
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,746
Why did it all happen?

444
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,256
Why that man knows me?

445
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,813
And these people, who are they at all?

446
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,120
God damn it!

447
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,517
How did you know, that I was in the church?

448
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,670
Because it was me!

449
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,240
I think, I'm Kang I-an.

450
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,390
What are you saying?

451
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,120
You started all this.

452
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,096
Hyundai, 3882!

453
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,920
If I-an dies,

454
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,190
I can kill you too.

455
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,830
Wait!

456
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,950
Wait!

457
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,600
Hey you!

458
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,426
Shit!

459
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,560
Hey!

460
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,656
I have no time at all.

461
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,947
You have bit different statements.

462
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,420
Do you see that car?

463
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,850
I was driving from there...

464
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,436
Ah...

465
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,596
Ah, I will loose my mind,
what is it do you think?

466
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,780
Don't move.

467
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,530
Move and you're dead.

468
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,036
Do you know Kang I-an?

469
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,796
What?

470
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,560
Tell me about him.

471
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,176
Why is everyone looking for him?

472
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,286
What are you trying to achieve now?

473
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,176
I don't remember anything now.

474
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,290
But I know, that 10mm deeper

475
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,256
and there will be carotid artery
and then you will die.

476
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,352
You know more about Kang I-an,
why do you ask me?

477
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,290
5mm left.

478
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,186
I'm doing only what I'm ordered.

479
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,696
I'm told to catch, then I catch.

480
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,356
To eliminate, then I eliminate.

481
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,086
Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo,

482
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,110
and me now.

483
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,106
Who are these people?

484
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,930
Why the fuck should I know?

485
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,333
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

486
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,446
The cop is coming.

487
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,220
Police, there is police!

488
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,096
When did you see Kang I-an?

489
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,556
When did you see him last time?

490
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,636
When he was escaping with the car
that had an accident.

491
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Don't lie!

492
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,636
There was only man in that car!

493
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,527
I really saw, how he drove off in that car!

494
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,790
Kang I-an was also in that car?

495
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,640
Till 8 o'clock you need to come
with the vehicle documents...

496
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,410
Moon Jin-ah and manager Yoo
came here, however

497
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,070
you just let them go, isn't it?

498
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,910
Curious, what are your trying to achieve?

499
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,520
Nothing.

500
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,220
Nothing?

501
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,090
What then?

502
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,406
Tomorrow they will hand
over the merchandise.

503
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,400
Till that time you
had to deal with everything.

504
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,190
I have a bad feeling.

505
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,947
Why Ji Cheol-ho lost his mind is not clear.

506
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,110
I have no idea why I have
the gun of Kang I-an.

507
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,563
Manager Yoo was strange also.

508
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,260
Everyone around, one by one...

509
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,010
Speak.

510
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,340
As you said, she is here.

511
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,670
What should I do?

512
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,530
Bring her?

513
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,020
Or just kill her right here?

514
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,170
No, watch her,

515
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,480
check where she will go.

516
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,710
They found Moon Jin-ah.

517
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,240
I handed it over to Jeongmo guys.

518
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,410
I can't trust you.

519
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
I'm leaving.

520
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,870
Did you bring it?

521
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,030
So what is it?

522
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,556
They say, that Kang I-an is
involved in some scam.

523
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,190
The mood in the office was just...

524
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,050
At least drink some water first.

525
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,346
List of people with
illegal medical practice.

526
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,314
There are scammers among them
and real doctors.

527
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,380
Some are treating foreigners in need.

528
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,160
Security intelligence service Korea.
Jose Luis.

529
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,310
Prakasi Latry.

530
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,256
Prakasi Latry, 42 years old, Nepal...

531
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Listen,

532
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,040
find him for me.

533
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,340
Is it him?

534
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,017
Are you sure, you
can manage it alone?

535
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,330
I'm begging you.

536
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,336
And give me a car.

537
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,666
Then give me 10k won.

538
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,030
What 10k, I sold you for one!

539
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,700
The price to sell and to buy
is not the same!

540
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,746
But I don't mind exchange rate fluctuation.

541
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,346
Sir.

542
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,246
What are you talking about?

543
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,226
You scared me.

544
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,450
Go, go!

545
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,086
Excuse me, just a moment.

546
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,946
Did you get the recorder
from that car in the morning?

547
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,566
What bullshit are you talking about?
You look like dumbass!

548
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,846
Shit, I'm leaving!

549
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,686
Sir.

550
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,336
I think, it's my car.

551
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,176
I need to find out what happened.

552
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,880
Where is the recorder?

553
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,950
Sir, do you know me?!

554
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,990
It's me, me, hotdog!

555
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,940
Shit, it's something from the other world.

556
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,300
I saw a lot of weird shit in my life

557
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,340
but you know, I see
this for the first time.

558
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,950
No, really.

559
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,143
You are the only one of a kind, right?

560
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
The soul leaves the body

561
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,180
and enters other bodies!

562
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,480
Isn't it?

563
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,563
Then do they have something in common?

564
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,650
So where is it? How far more?

565
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,080
We are here.

566
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,640
Right there.

567
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,190
Hurry up!

568
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,190
How come?
Today everyone lost their mind.

569
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,176
Ah these people.

570
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Shit.

571
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,980
Listen...

572
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,096
I almost died, shit.

573
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,896
Listen,

574
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,276
give me back please
what I've sold you.

575
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,416
That recorder.

576
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,426
You are kidding, right?

577
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,450
Beggar!

578
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,706
Listen,

579
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,776
I don't need the device.

580
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,733
Just give me the memory card.

581
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,420
Beggars, you stink, get lost!

582
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,390
Or pay.

583
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,870
Do you have money?

584
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,280
What are you staring at?

585
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,180
Card is ok?

586
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,870
Yes.

587
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,770
Speak.

588
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,577
Check the place and send the boys.

589
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,198
What an idiot to use a card
when you are wanted?

590
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,390
Sir.

591
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,820
These are memory cards,

592
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,476
that we removed from recorders.

593
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,776
But I don't know which one it is.

594
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,480
You can take them all.

595
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,286
Then can we check them here?

596
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,866
You can do it in that room!

597
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,516
Thank you.

598
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,540
Yeah.

599
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,626
According to recording,
the last person he contacted

600
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,166
is Russian Dima.

601
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,230
First find him.

602
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,316
Have some coffee.

603
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,026
Thank you.

604
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,050
Yes.

605
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Oh!

606
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,670
What?

607
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,310
I think, I found.

608
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,770
Gun! Gun!

609
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,120
What is it?

610
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,110
I think it's him.

611
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,200
Him?

612
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,720
It is me.

613
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,160
Where is he heading to?

614
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,200
Will see now.

615
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,660
Uh.

616
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,356
We are closed already.

617
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,420
Come tomorrow

618
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,920
You are Yoo Joon-Young?

619
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,130
They are...

620
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,800
What should we do?

621
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,490
Come here.

622
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,260
Sir.

623
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,060
Run!

624
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,650
You go that way.

625
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,356
Let me go!

626
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Sir!

627
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,360
Shit!

628
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:23,960
Sir!

629
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,570
Let go, shithead!

630
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:42,890
Hey!

631
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,890
You lost your mind?

632
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,460
Sorry.

633
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,620
What the...

634
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,036
Who are you?

635
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,060
Let me go!

636
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,910
It's on the right side.
What are you doing?

637
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,240
Yes, director Park.

638
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,176
Moon Jin-ah is in the black car.

639
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,800
We are following it.

640
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,733
We are leaving north Hannam bridge.

641
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:55,770
Yes.

642
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
What?

643
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,340
Understood.

644
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,620
We will immediately bring her.

645
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,100
Yes.

646
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,800
Understood.

647
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Hey.

648
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,410
Who are you?

649
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,740
Shit...

650
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,728
Not everything in life
goes the way you want it?

651
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,280
Same for me.

652
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,540
Because of you.

653
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,490
Where were you hiding?

654
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,610
How did you find me?

655
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,010
NOAH MOOLSAN

656
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,210
Noah Moolsan?

657
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,350
Noah Moolsan?

658
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,410
Noah Moolsan...

659
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,130
Why empty handed?

660
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,470
Hmm...

661
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:25,260
You were looking for Moon Jin-ah
and Kang I-an, why are you here?

662
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,400
And where is Park?

663
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,180
He will...

664
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,810
come soon.

665
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,883
Together with Moon Jin-ah.

666
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,830
Come here.

667
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,302
Why are you hiding your eyes,
when I'm talking to you?

668
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,790
Sorry.

669
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,050
Excuse me...

670
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,240
This man...

671
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,270
Who are you?

672
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,700
They were together.

673
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,600
Beggar, I think.

674
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,770
He lost his mind.

675
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,410
Get rid of him.

676
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,400
Why get rid...

677
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,156
I

678
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,726
How could you...

679
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,446
will get rid of him.

680
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,046
do this to a person...

681
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,090
Help!

682
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,510
Mercy!

683
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,546
Mercy!

684
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,570
Get out!

685
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,350
Get out!

686
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,640
Help!

687
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,190
Get out you idiot!

688
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,146
You are done!

689
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:34,906
I need to go...

690
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,940
Get out!

691
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,676
No!

692
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,950
Quiet, please!

693
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,780
This man has changed the body!

694
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,066
He said, he wants to find himself!

695
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,370
On the recorder!

696
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,056
Sir!

697
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,080
Hey!

698
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,670
I told you...

699
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,100
Shut up, beggar!

700
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,526
Do you know something about Noah Moolsan?

701
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,020
Maybe I know it.

702
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,520
Sure, I know it.

703
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,640
I don't know.

704
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,190
You are a bit strange.

705
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,240
Your way of speaking

706
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,426
is really strange.

707
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,970
As if it's not you.

708
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,150
Why is it so many freaks lately?

709
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,980
Right.

710
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,540
Park was right.

711
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,790
He said, something similar happened to me.

712
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,730
And that time

713
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,910
I looked really like you?

714
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,670
What is her name?

715
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Come on.

716
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,770
If you don't remember,
then don't tell.

717
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,860
Soon-Young, what is it?

718
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,630
We had a business here.

719
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,400
Soon-Young.

720
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,960
Soon-Young?

721
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,370
She feels offended now probably.

722
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,000
That you don't even remember
the name of your girlfriend.

723
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,060
Strange.

724
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,560
Very.

725
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,270
But my name is really Soon-Young.

726
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,150
I am Hwang Soon-Young.

727
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,710
Chief will come tomorrow,
now leave the place.

728
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,086
Do you get, what I'm talking about?

729
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,110
Yes.

730
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:07,650
Let's go.

731
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,350
let's go!

732
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,440
Where are you and what are doing?

733
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,580
Sorry.

734
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,460
There was an accident.

735
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,350
What accident?

736
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,580
I will tell everything...

737
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,620
This crazy...

738
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,750
Listen...

739
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,160
He is really crazy...

740
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,260
His body is always changing!

741
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,960
Sir! It's me, hotdog.

742
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,060
You know me.

743
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,990
I'm loosing my mind.

744
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,040
Why are you doing this to me?!

745
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,890
He said,

746
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,360
that Ko Joon-sa

747
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,230
and you are losers.

748
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,590
Dima?

749
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,790
Did you see him?

750
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,500
I have no idea.
I don't speak Korean.

751
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,600
<i>National Intelligence Service.</i>
Passport.

752
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,133
I have no time to deal with you.

753
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,800
But if you want,

754
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,800
I can investigate you.

755
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,930
I heard it is somewhere in Namyangju.

756
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,340
Maybe at some factory.

757
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,130
Where is Kang I-an?

758
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,180
Kang I-an...

759
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,040
I don't know, where he is.

760
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,670
So it is better.

761
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,790
When I escaped,

762
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,030
I decided to come and check,

763
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,350
and he was there.

764
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,320
So and where it that "there"?!

765
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,900
Where?!

766
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,920
Well...

767
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,200
Curious?

768
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,250
Yes.

769
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,510
Kang I-an is my friend.

770
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,950
I know, where he is.

771
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,910
But I will not tell you.

772
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,640
Fucking junkie.

773
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,050
How long will you keep looking?

774
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,730
It is broken.

775
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,836
This is the end.

776
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,396
It's past midnight already.

777
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,136
And the moon is on the right side.

778
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,500
The car is heading south-east.

779
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,200
Highway 66.

780
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,150
Heading south-east on the highway 66.

781
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,270
How do you know all this?

782
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,580
Even if it is so, we can not
search all the highway.

783
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,350
Highway 66?

784
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,920
One moment.

785
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,860
I think I know, where it is.

786
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,206
Hi.

787
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,926
Can you send me the location?

788
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,816
I'm searching, but I didn't
find the exact location yet.

789
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,630
I'm trying, wait.

790
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,500
Pyeongnae-dong, 34-7.

791
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,790
Namyangju, Pyeongnae-dong, 34-7.

792
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,160
Yes, Soon-Jin.

793
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,696
Did you find out?

794
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,750
Yes. In Ulsan. Namyangju, Pyeongnae-dong

795
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,960
Namyangju?

796
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,980
Yes.

797
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,990
Ok, got it, Thank you.

798
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,920
You were on the highway
from Namyangju, right?

799
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:06,950
Sure?

800
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,980
Namyangju...

801
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,140
Namyangju...

802
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:16,446
There is...

803
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,880
a factory in Namyangju, that our
agents used before as a safe house.

804
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,910
Yes?

805
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,136
There was also the
doctor from Nepal, right?

806
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,440
Right, isn't it?

807
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,270
Right.

808
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,436
What do you need?

809
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,460
Excuse me.

810
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,346
On 12th in the night you were
treating a man, who was driving Korando.

811
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,970
Don't know anything.

812
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Move away.

813
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,010
NOAH MOOLSAN

814
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Who are you?

815
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,476
What are you doing here?

816
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,000
Get out of here!

817
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,126
Wait, wait. You didn't get it?
Get out of here!

818
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,880
Yes, yes, thank you...

819
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,880
So loud...

820
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,300
I think it's not here.

821
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,970
Maybe you got it wrong?

822
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,160
It is definitely here.

823
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,790
I can feel it.

824
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,500
Is it him?

825
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:15,930
Yes.

826
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,590
I found my body.

827
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,706
We go in immediately when it's surrounded.

828
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,410
Wait for the order.

829
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,580
I have a bad feeling about it.

830
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,776
It will be fun.

831
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,160
Let's get inside.

832
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,116
Check if merchandise is there.

833
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,736
Put a cordon outside.

834
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,440
Search the area around.

835
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:02,160
End of operation: 5:27.

836
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,730
Let's count.

837
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
Name of deceased: Jae I-myung.

838
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:12,422
Lost merchandise - new drug
from Thailand called "Eterecs".

839
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,706
Unlike other drugs

840
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,126
this one places you in
a near death state of mind,

841
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,746
like you are separated from your body.

842
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,956
Small capsules are getting
in blood stream

843
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,750
and rupture every 12 hours

844
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,706
keeping hallucinations in effect.

845
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,716
Due to high strength of the drug
there are many side effects.

846
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:30,166
Common are hearing hallucinations
and some physical symptoms.

847
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,550
In worst case

848
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,700
you loose memory and then die.

849
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,870
Lost merchandise weighs 3570kg
and costs 25 billion won.

850
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,476
If it will hit the market, it's the end.

851
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,033
I need to talk. Come out for a moment.

852
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,200
Kang I-an!

853
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,310
Yes.

854
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,966
You still didn't find the
location of Yoo Joon-Youngа?

855
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:49,300
No, not yet.

856
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,076
He is definitely connected
to the events today.

857
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,396
If you will get any info about him
immediately report to me.

858
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,220
Report about all movements.

859
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,490
How many times did we find
bodies instead of drugs?

860
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,456
If we will not deal with it,

861
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,976
we will have to ask for
help from the police.

862
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,546
Let's not disgrace ourselves.

863
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,610
Yeah.

864
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:11,490
Where were you hiding all this time?

865
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,997
Some place here, some place there.

866
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:21,190
Why do you have my lighter?

867
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,310
Why was it at the crime scene?

868
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:25,876
Inside the organization

869
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,166
there are some, who kill the
drug dealers and lay their hands on drugs.

870
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,606
Is it not because you leaked the information?

871
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,360
They forged the evidence.

872
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,856
I investigated that,

873
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,766
that's why they pinned that to me

874
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:36,596
and they are looking for me now.

875
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,870
Cut the crap.

876
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,390
Turn yourself in.

877
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,540
Get your hand out.

878
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,940
Trust me.

879
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,150
Get your hand out, I said!

880
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,430
Check it.

881
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,160
Did you call Park?

882
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,696
I said, you are turning yourself in.

883
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,970
Do not resist.

884
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,540
Make sure to check it.

885
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,720
It's cold.

886
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,510
Did you wait long?

887
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,353
Sorry, I had some urgent things to do.

888
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,366
So if I'm here,
should I come in and confess?

889
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,160
Confess what?

890
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,910
Confess at home.

891
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,540
Seoul has a great night view.

892
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,350
Yes, indeed.

893
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,280
What is it?

894
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,740
What happened?

895
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,930
Joon-Young...

896
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,870
Manager Yoo?

897
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,210
Yes.

898
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:02,996
He is wanted since last week,
he leaked all inside information.

899
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,020
What?

900
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:07,316
I've though a lot about it,
but I reported him.

901
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,860
Not a nice feeling.

902
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,260
So that's why

903
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,560
you were so down?

904
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,436
And what to do now?

905
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,993
Call from head office.
Probably urgent.

906
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,740
Let's talk at home.

907
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,446
They say some cops lay
their hands on drugs.

908
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,106
Are you them?

909
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:31,526
Yes.

910
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,990
We are those cops.

911
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,730
Leave what you have and get off.

912
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,790
Nothing to say?

913
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,620
If you leave quietly,
nobody will get hurt.

914
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,450
It's your choice.

915
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,016
Hey, shit!

916
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:46,956
What the...?

917
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,436
Where are you going? What is it?

918
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,760
Jin-ah.

919
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,790
Who are you?

920
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,916
Hey!

921
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,940
Shit!

922
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,570
Where are you?

923
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,900
And where are you?

924
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,240
Chief Park?

925
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,356
Jin-ah!

926
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,106
I-an!

927
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,130
Jin-ah!

928
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,860
Jin-ah!

929
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:16,616
I-an!

930
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,640
Stop it.

931
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,100
Jin-ah!

932
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,790
He must be calmed down.

933
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,020
I-an!

934
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,736
I-an!

935
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,416
I will kill you, bastards!

936
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,910
I-an!

937
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,160
I-an!

938
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,290
No!

939
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,086
Stop!

940
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,580
No! No!

941
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,730
I-an...

942
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,350
I-an!

943
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,890
I-an!

944
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:32,976
No!

945
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,490
That's Eterecs.

946
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,467
You can't buy a dose for your salary.

947
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,677
How do you find "near death experience"?

948
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,240
Why are you doing this...

949
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:45,150
Lost your mind?

950
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,440
Where is it?

951
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,710
Why did you get involved in this?

952
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,690
Ah!

953
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,260
No, no.

954
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,410
You started it right?

955
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,470
You killed these two.

956
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,700
And killed yourself.

957
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,140
Good story?

958
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,590
And the scene...

959
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,890
Think of it yourself.

960
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,160
Jin-ah...

961
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,760
I-an...

962
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,550
I-an...

963
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,620
I-an!

964
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,640
Jin-ah!

965
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:57,130
I-an!

966
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,520
Jin-ah...

967
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,660
Jin-ah...

968
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,310
I-an...

969
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,510
I love you...

970
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,460
Jin-ah! Are you ok?

971
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,780
I-an!

972
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,046
Jin-ah!

973
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,260
What is it?

974
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,670
This...

975
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,180
What is it?

976
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,030
Jin-ah!

977
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
Let go!

978
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
I-an!

979
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,220
No time!

980
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,220
Hey, hey, hey!

981
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,460
Latry!

982
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,116
How is that?!

983
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,056
Hey, guys!

984
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,320
Help! Hurry!

985
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:19,486
Hurry!

986
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:20,510
Hurry!

987
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,200
Jin-ah...

988
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:01,890
Found.

989
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,853
Adjacent building, 4th floor.

990
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,010
What are you doing here?

991
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:10,870
What are you doing?

992
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,230
I was thinking,

993
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,200
what really happened to me.

994
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,360
What?

995
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,830
And I figured out,

996
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:29,840
what I have to do now.

997
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:41,286
You asked, what do they have in common?

998
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,360
Me?

999
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,510
They were there that day.

1000
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,690
I'm transferring into them.

1001
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:48,516
So..

1002
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,340
...you remember everything?

1003
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:51,766
Jin-ah

1004
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:54,416
I-an, where are you? Call me.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid. Call me.

1005
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,830
What should I do?

1006
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:59,020
We are surrounded outside
by guys with guns!

1007
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,916
They are here because of you?

1008
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,566
Me?

1009
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,570
I?..Me?..

1010
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:04,960
Leave, hurry.

1011
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,656
I don't need a massacre here!

1012
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,470
Get out of here now!

1013
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,960
Listen.

1014
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,280
Sorry,

1015
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,420
but take care of this.

1016
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,087
Take care... take care of what?

1017
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,980
Is it her Park was talking about?

1018
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,530
Chief?

1019
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,190
Are you ok?

1020
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,563
There are armed people there!

1021
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,890
It seems...

1022
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,736
I-An is also somewhere near.

1023
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,910
Got it.

1024
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,530
Wait in the car.

1025
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,670
Chief Lee!

1026
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,730
Chief!

1027
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,870
I don't...

1028
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,570
What are you going to do?

1029
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,697
Do you know how much is that deal?

1030
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,923
Do you want to spoil everything?

1031
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:15,730
Chief Lee...

1032
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,176
The police will arrive soon,
so let's finish fast.

1033
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,700
No!

1034
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,440
What the...?

1035
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,640
Drive!

1036
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,770
Get out!

1037
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,090
Stop!

1038
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:04,220
Flight 8700...

1039
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,210
Still taking drugs?

1040
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,480
No peace with you, not at all!

1041
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:39,010
How many did you kill already,
God damn it?

1042
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:44,520
I told you, not to handle
Kang I-an like that.

1043
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,807
You wanted so much to do it your way?

1044
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,160
Hired some junkie.

1045
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,826
You want to get my place?

1046
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,106
I will deal with everything.

1047
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,376
I've dealt with everything till now.

1048
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,756
I caught Moon Jin-ah.

1049
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,046
And manager Yoo.

1050
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,330
And later...
caught Kang I-an too.

1051
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,046
Ah, no, didn't catch yet...
but soon I will!

1052
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,750
Do I need something else?

1053
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,190
Ah?

1054
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,956
What are you so afraid of,

1055
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,113
why are you screwing me, shit...

1056
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:28,416
You saw her in the church,
why did you let her go?

1057
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,440
Ah?

1058
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,680
What are you going to do?

1059
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,790
Ou-ou.

1060
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,440
You we sent again to follow me?

1061
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,490
It seems so. And you are so busy.

1062
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,680
Hey, did we meet in the church?

1063
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:48,870
She said no.

1064
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,670
You are always the good one.

1065
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,060
Ah?

1066
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,456
You picked me first,

1067
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,160
said, I was brilliant.

1068
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,216
What?

1069
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,600
What again? What?

1070
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,300
Ah?

1071
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,426
Ah you shithead...

1072
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,130
What are you staring at?

1073
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,060
Joon-Young!

1074
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:45,650
Joon-Young!

1075
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:47,200
Joon-Young!

1076
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,680
Joon-Young...

1077
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,413
They all were there that day.

1078
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,410
I'm transferring into them.

1079
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,430
Park, get up!

1080
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,560
Wake up!

1081
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,576
What are you doing?

1082
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,970
Calm down.

1083
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,200
We must get out of here.

1084
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,280
Ah, shit!

1085
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,110
It's you, chief Chung!

1086
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:46,930
Who are you?

1087
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,470
What about Lee?

1088
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,760
Well,

1089
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,140
he is sick.

1090
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,430
Getting rest.

1091
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,550
Getting rest?

1092
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,580
He is strange lately.

1093
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,706
Well, it always like this with people.

1094
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:00,350
They are strange.

1095
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:17,910
Enough?

1096
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,930
Bring the merchandise.

1097
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:22,210
Yes.

1098
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,366
You said, you tested it?

1099
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,390
Of course.

1100
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,300
Thoroughly tested.

1101
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,000
Park, what is it?

1102
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,170
Where is Jin-ah?

1103
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,070
You motherfucker!

1104
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,036
What was it?

1105
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,860
Hey, what is that gunshot?

1106
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,856
Check it.

1107
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,826
What's wrong?

1108
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:25,996
You want to set me up?

1109
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:28,110
No, not really!

1110
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,550
This is Park.

1111
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,040
Park?

1112
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,316
Hey!

1113
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,986
He is not working for you?

1114
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:51,066
That bustard...

1115
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,176
What are you waiting for?

1116
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,200
Kill him.

1117
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,706
Bastard.

1118
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,650
Rat! Sitting here.

1119
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:00,660
Move!

1120
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,620
Fucking looser!

1121
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:05,690
Made some shit behind my back?

1122
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:10,202
You piss me off.
Can't even clean it up, idiot...

1123
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,250
What are you staring at!

1124
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,580
Be quiet.

1125
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:20,350
I can't concentrate!

1126
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:31,510
What do you want from me,
fucking idiots?

1127
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,430
Ah?

1128
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:46,020
He is nuts.

1129
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:48,716
If you stayed alive,
you better run away.

1130
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,856
Did you come here to make a mess?

1131
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,880
Ah?

1132
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,900
Ah?

1133
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,750
What is that?

1134
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:39,270
Why are you here?

1135
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:40,690
Come here.

1136
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,660
There is something interesting here.

1137
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:43,810
Where is Jin-ah

1138
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,800
Where is Jin-ah?!

1139
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,470
Have you lost your mind?

1140
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,200
Hey!

1141
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,127
How do you want to deal with that?

1142
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:16,753
You got your revenge already.

1143
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,660
Stop it.

1144
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,580
You are Park?

1145
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,840
Not Park, right?

1146
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,100
Drop the gun and come out.

1147
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,380
If you don't want her
to die come out!

1148
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:50,430
Won't come out?

1149
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,060
I will shoot her.

1150
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,520
Ah?

1151
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,470
You don't care, right?

1152
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:57,610
I will shoot.

1153
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,680
Don't do it.

1154
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,510
Ok?

1155
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,600
Don't torture her anymore.

1156
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,110
You,

1157
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:21,340
who are you?

1158
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:26,710
And how do you think?

1159
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:32,300
You?

1160
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:34,330
You...

1161
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,530
You...

1162
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,360
Don't know, it's hard.

1163
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,266
Kang I-an?

1164
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,156
Park?

1165
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,913
Are you a ghost, shithead?

1166
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,350
Ghost, right?

1167
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:41,790
Ah, ghost?

1168
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,430
Now I got it.

1169
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,367
Ghost or whatever it is you are...

1170
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,367
The main thing is the story.

1171
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:37,490
The story now will be

1172
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,860
that you lost your mind,

1173
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:42,490
took drugs and assaulted me.

1174
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,410
Are you kidding?

1175
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,020
Playing with me?

1176
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:57,140
Fuck...

1177
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,290
I-an?

1178
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,900
I-an, right?

1179
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:50,230
Did you wait long?

1180
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:55,870
Sorry.

1181
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:02,150
I had an urgent business.

1182
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,620
I have to

1183
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,390
confess...

1184
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,200
I-an!

1185
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:37,610
Wait...

1186
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,500
Wait!

1187
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,070
I-an!

1188
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:55,790
I-an!

1189
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:59,700
I-an!

1190
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,530
I-an!

1191
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:32,490
USB flash stick

1192
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:37,360
we gave to specialists of KAIST,
but small chance to recover.

1193
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:41,382
And it is not clear,
when Kang I-an will be conscious.

1194
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,240
But I want to ask you.

1195
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,990
Here.

1196
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:52,540
Why all of them

1197
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:55,240
were so eager to save you?

1198
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,550
I just can't understand it.

1199
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,240
It is not them.

1200
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,750
It is one man.

1201
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,100
SPIRITWALKER

1
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,730
Oh.

2
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,760
You are conscious now.

3
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,937
Thank God. I thought you are dead.

4
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,730
S...sit tight.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,626
You know...

6
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,560
Maybe you broke something.

7
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,560
Don't move.

8
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Where am I?

9
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,030
Why am I...

10
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,210
Listen, sir.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,410
I've already called emergency.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
They are coming.

13
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,660
So...

14
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,450
I am leaving.

15
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,900
Good luck.

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,540
Sir.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,850
You are saying,

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,586
that you don't remember who you are?

19
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
And no ID?

20
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,550
Your car

21
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,926
was towed to Wonchang
junkyard in Ulsan.

22
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,310
Take my card.

23
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,350
The car is registered to Kang I-an.

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,100
This is not you?

25
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,850
Doctor said

26
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,663
you have a gunshot wound
in your shoulder.

27
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
You don't remember this?

28
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,196
If it's really a gunshot wound,

29
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,186
you need to report it to the police

30
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,970
and clear all details.

31
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,050
I asked for a room, we can talk there.

32
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,080
Wait a bit.

33
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,850
Ok.

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,100
Maybe we should contact
criminal department?

35
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,310
Ji Cheol-ho...

36
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,590
Ji Cheol-ho...

37
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,616
Make sure to check it.

38
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's talk at home.

39
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,680
What is it?

40
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,650
You don't feel good?

41
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,640
What's wrong?

42
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,970
What is it with him?

43
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,430
Is he crazy?

44
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,960
What is it?

45
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
This is a dream...

46
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,250
How come?

47
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,800
Why so?

48
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,100
What the...

49
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
What is happening?

50
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
I...

51
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,890
I...

52
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,066
How many times do I need to tell,
that it was not me?

53
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,023
I told you, I don't remember.

54
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,120
What are you talking about?

55
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,150
Why would I do it?

56
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,156
Hey.

57
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,016
When I opened my eyes,
I was already at home.

58
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,036
I'm coming to you.

59
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,996
Let's meet.

60
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,556
Hello?

61
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,940
Are you really...

62
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,970
Wait...

63
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,200
Hold on!

64
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,430
Wait...

65
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,610
I'm not...

66
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,660
Ah, wait!

67
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Get in!

68
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:23,000
SPIRITWALKER

69
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,520
ID. Lee Shin-woo.

70
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,266
Delivery New World.
Chief Lee Shin-woo.

71
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,440
Shin-woo?

72
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,010
Chief.

73
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
Chief Lee Shin-woo?

74
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
You won't go inside?

75
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,640
Chief Lee!

76
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,260
What is it with him?

77
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,020
Where is he going?

78
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,050
This will nobody buy from you!

79
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,750
Let's not bring useless stuff!

80
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,746
It is not useless!

81
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,586
Have a look!

82
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,910
I just want to eat pancake.

83
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,050
Ah?

84
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,346
It is so delicious when it's hot...

85
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,266
Then.

86
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,970
Here is 1000 won for you.

87
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,856
Take it.

88
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Thousand?

89
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,620
Are you kidding?

90
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't want?

91
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,360
Shithead.

92
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,046
Took everything for himself, shithead.

93
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,246
Don't buy alcohol!

94
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,270
I won't!

95
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,570
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,650
You startled me.

97
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,740
Is it not rude to take someone's seat?

98
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Oh God.

99
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,230
Human life is priceless.

100
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,290
Why spend it for this?

101
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Sir.

102
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,406
Do you remember the man who had
a car accident today in the morning?

103
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,640
178cm tall.

104
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,180
About 80kg weight?

105
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,740
It was me.

106
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,920
But suddenly

107
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,830
I became like this.

108
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
What?

109
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,750
The body changed.

110
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,380
Bullshit, right?

111
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,066
You know,

112
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,020
I don't quiet understand
what you mean.

113
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,687
I don't know which one of them is me.

114
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,440
I don't remember anything.

115
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,486
I know where is Seoul

116
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,150
and where is Gwanghwamun station.

117
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,660
But who I am, I don't know.

118
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,270
I think, I know.

119
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,286
It's written here.

120
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,577
"Delivery New World. Lee Shin-woo"

121
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,200
This man is not me.

122
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,680
Then who is he?

123
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,920
This man.

124
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,146
Lee Shin-woo?

125
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,170
Yes?

126
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,606
You see, you are Lee Shin-woo.

127
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,116
I am not Lee Shin-woo.

128
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,400
Then who is he?

129
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,470
This man.

130
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,896
And you are not Lee Shin-woo?

131
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,586
No.

132
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,726
And where is he?

133
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750
Right here.

134
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,896
This man is Lee Shin-woo?

135
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,196
Yes this man is Lee Shin-woo.

136
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,580
Then who are you?

137
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,910
I...

138
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,066
Today in the morning you
wore a brown coat,

139
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,756
a cap with Spider-Man,

140
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,050
a green scarf

141
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,640
and gloves.

142
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,683
And you called the emergency.

143
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,740
Then...

144
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,846
that man in the morning didn't die,

145
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,120
and now he is in that body?

146
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,380
No.

147
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,230
He was fine.

148
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,096
But honestly don't know,
how he is now.

149
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,130
Then

150
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
it's Lee Shin-woo who is dead?

151
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,836
No.

152
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,046
Then who is dead?

153
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,210
Nobody died!

154
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,910
Both didn't die.

155
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,690
And both are not me!

156
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,720
How do you know this?

157
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
What?

158
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,296
You we saying, you
don't know who you are.

159
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,920
So how can you know, that it's not you?

160
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,530
Indeed.

161
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,210
How can I know?

162
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,446
Sir.

163
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,470
Sir!

164
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,100
Which one do you want most?

165
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,706
What?

166
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,546
Choose one.

167
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,090
Will give for free.

168
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,626
I don't want to eat it.

169
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,626
Why you don't want?

170
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,960
I see, you are staring at hotdog!

171
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,590
You like it more than doughnut
or rice pancake.

172
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
See.

173
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,510
You exist.

174
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,060
And you like it.

175
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes?

176
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,270
And I like more

177
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,980
this doughnut.

178
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,050
Oh.

179
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,280
Everyone has that period of life.

180
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,630
All these people

181
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,610
don't know who they are.

182
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,360
But this is not important.

183
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,256
In our life

184
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,186
more important is where you are from

185
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,546
and where you are heading to.

186
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,250
So where are you from?

187
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,740
You don't know?

188
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,036
If you don't know,
then go to the beginning.

189
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,460
That way you will find out
where you are heading to.

190
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,040
What is it?

191
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,610
Hey.

192
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,146
What is it?

193
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,210
Why did you help Kang I-an?!

194
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,516
Remember something?

195
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,746
How many times to repeat?!

196
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,030
Go back to the very beginning.

197
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,226
To the very beginning.

198
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,410
Yes, right.

199
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,880
There are many people,
who don't remember their past.

200
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,170
Kang I-an is really...

201
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,750
So you will continue that way?

202
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,746
You don't believe?

203
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,986
You don't believe me?!

204
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,570
It was not me!

205
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,090
Not me!

206
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,556
I was doing everything,
what was ordered!

207
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,406
Let go!

208
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,386
Let go, damn!

209
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,460
Let go!

210
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,890
Wait!

211
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,700
You shithead!

212
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,520
Where am I?

213
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
Who are you?

214
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,530
What?

215
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,063
You went back so far to the beginning?

216
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,490
I

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,080
will leave for a moment.

218
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,456
Hey!

219
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,900
Wait!

220
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,700
What is it?

221
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,030
Soon-Young, what is it?

222
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,470
We will...

223
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,726
Wait.

224
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,456
Just listen...

225
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,960
I think, somebody got inside.

226
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,606
Then who? I put a sign.

227
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,310
Somebody opened the door!

228
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,070
Is there someone?

229
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,766
Nobody is there!

230
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,100
Sure there is!

231
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,130
Look!

232
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,496
Why are you doing this to me?

233
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,800
Won't come out?!

234
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,740
You didn't see the sign...

235
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,530
Excuse me.

236
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,800
We are...

237
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,160
We are on business her.

238
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,360
She just drank too much,
so she felt sick.

239
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,923
This is not, what you are thinking.

240
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,360
It changed again.

241
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,990
During the day.

242
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,480
And during the night.

243
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,960
And during the night...

244
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,180
12 o'clock.

245
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,200
Calm down.

246
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,650
Go back to the beginning.

247
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,640
Yes.

248
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,070
To the beginning.

249
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,410
Junkyard Wonchang.

250
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,610
Let's talk at home.

251
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,160
"All this evil is coming from
inside and corrupting the man", God says.

252
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,910
God says.

253
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,790
Praise God.

254
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,660
Praise God.

255
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,410
Dear brothers and sisters,

256
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,480
let's pray for the peace.

257
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,730
Don't move.

258
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,100
Looking for me?

259
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,560
Kill.

260
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,266
I don't know what...

261
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,680
Don't move.

262
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,600
Where is Kang?

263
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,840
Listen to me.

264
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,486
I am not the one,
who you are seeing...

265
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,030
Where is Kang I-an?

266
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,880
Who are you talking about?
I don't know.

267
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
I will count to three.

268
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,090
Who are you?

269
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,110
One.

270
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,910
I think I know you.

271
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,280
Explain to me.

272
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,576
How do you know me?

273
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,630
Who are you?

274
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,386
Two.

275
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,186
Photo.

276
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,520
I have a photo.

277
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,566
I brought it from that car.

278
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,796
I was inside it.

279
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,586
Three.

280
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,810
Wait.

281
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,430
Wait.

282
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,150
I really, really don't know anything.

283
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,740
Tell me, where he is.

284
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,390
Really.

285
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,923
Oh... how did I do that...

286
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,450
One moment.

287
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,106
Relax.

288
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,200
Calm down.

289
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
This is

290
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,410
you, right?

291
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,810
What are you doing there?

292
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,580
You know me, right?

293
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,610
Who am I?

294
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,976
What?

295
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,280
What am I doi...

296
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,580
What am I doing?

297
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,970
Excuse me, I took the wrong seat.

298
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
I have to go, I'm leaving.

299
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
Wait.

300
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
Then maybe

301
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,990
you know her?

302
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,850
No, I have no idea.

303
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,790
Then who is that man,
who you met in the toilet?

304
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,170
Where did he go?

305
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,346
And who were those men in the warehouse?

306
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,920
Go Joong-sa?

307
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,996
Yes.

308
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,906
Go Jongsma.

309
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,290
Where is he?

310
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,680
Yes.

311
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,040
I think here.

312
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,640
Yes.

313
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,960
Here?

314
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,910
Yes, he says to go to the second floor.

315
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,440
I don't know, I'm scared.

316
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,620
Ok bye, he is coming up.

317
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,050
Are you here?

318
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,066
You don't have to be here.

319
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,610
What are you doing?

320
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,306
We have already set up the scene.

321
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,720
And the legend.

322
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,796
Recently a woman pointed a gun at me.

323
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,416
Short hair, about 167cm tall.

324
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,136
Double eyelid, several moles on the left.

325
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,086
In her 20's.

326
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,986
You are talking about Moon Jin-ah?

327
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,836
Moon Jin-ah?

328
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,660
Moles on the left you said?

329
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,980
Is it her?

330
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,856
I think yes, Moon Jin-ah.

331
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,246
What relationship do you have with her?

332
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,310
Relationship?

333
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,060
We didn't have any.

334
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,090
Ah no.

335
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,666
So.

336
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,370
Do you know her address?

337
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,070
One moment.

338
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,136
Kahwedong district, 11,

339
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,760
house 27.

340
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,000
Apartment 102.

341
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
One month passed already.

342
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,870
Hey, who am I talking to?

343
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,560
Kahwedong, 11, house 27...

344
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,366
Ah?

345
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,106
Kahwedong, 11...

346
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,810
What's wrong with him?

347
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
What is it?

348
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,840
Are you ok?

349
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,088
Kahwedong district, 11, house 27.
Apartment 102.

350
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,210
NOAH MOOLSAN

351
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,230
DELIVERY "NEW WORLD"

352
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,580
Kahwedong, 11, house 27...

353
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,760
11-27...

354
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,010
Namyang highway, 37 minutes ago.

355
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,076
What do you think,

356
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
who is it?

357
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,306
Manager Park Joon-Young, right?

358
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,930
Is he really wanted?

359
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,656
How long will you let it go?

360
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,147
Till he leaks all inside information?

361
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,230
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,466
I will immediately
track his location and...

363
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,930
Are you a parrot?!

364
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,426
It is already a week that you
try to "immediately" track his location!

365
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,990
What about Kang I-an?

366
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,266
He was 48 hours late with his report.

367
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,546
It's early yet to say, that he
is connected to manager Yoo.

368
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,830
In this case not early.

369
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,316
You will put yourself together,
when you will get fired?

370
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,476
And the responsible is not coming.

371
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,780
We need to gather them all.

372
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,530
He is coming at last, dumbass.

373
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,700
ID. Kang I-an.

374
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,100
Kang I-an.

375
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,376
Could you reach Kang I-an?

376
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,066
He is the best agent in our team.

377
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,290
You know, that this is difficult.

378
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,040
Bride?

379
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,727
Her phone was switched off the same day.

380
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,800
First we reported her
missing to the police.

381
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,332
But if the chief agrees,
I will start looking for her.

382
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,450
After we catch manager Yoo.

383
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,810
Don't rush.

384
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,156
If the news will get to the
head office like the last time,

385
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,650
we will all get problems.

386
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,688
Manager Yoo, Moon Jin-ah and Kang I-an
disappeared at the same time.

387
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,790
I think we should hurry.

388
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,270
First find manager Yoo.

389
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,400
Got it.

390
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,942
Kang I-an, the girl from the church,
Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo,

391
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,610
Noah Moolsan...

392
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,670
Kang I-an

393
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,950
Everybody knows Kang I-an.

394
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,310
Kang I-an.

395
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,840
Kang I-an...

396
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,770
Where is Kang I-an?

397
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,450
Hold on.

398
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,770
Where are you leaving?

399
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,310
Come with me.

400
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,350
Calm down.

401
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,810
Ah shit...

402
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,090
You will get hurt.

403
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,056
Where are you going?

404
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Shit.

405
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,840
This car. Get in faster.

406
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,280
Moon Jin-ah!

407
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,740
Hurry, get in!

408
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,100
Hold on.

409
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,220
Manager Yoo!

410
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,900
Fucking shithead!

411
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,960
Where is I-an?

412
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,690
Wait...

413
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,680
Where is I-an?

414
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,120
I want to know it too.

415
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,776
When I came back that day,

416
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,260
there was nobody.

417
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,946
They are also looking for I-an.

418
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,346
So have has to be alive.

419
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,730
So that I-an...

420
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
He is immobilized,

421
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,946
so he has to be treated somewhere.

422
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,970
Hold tight!

423
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,956
Listen.

424
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,956
It will be hard to understand.

425
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,066
But listen to me.

426
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,326
Something strange is happening to me.

427
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,076
First, I'm not the person,
who you see now.

428
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,936
I'm in a different body now.

429
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,366
But the bodies always change.

430
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:55,996
Twice a day.

431
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,556
At midnight and midday.

432
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,646
Always changing to someone different.

433
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,166
What are you talking about?

434
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,056
In the church today it was also me.

435
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,106
You were threatening me with a gun.

436
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,390
Who is real me?

437
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,436
What is happening?

438
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,036
I don't remember anything about it!

439
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,850
I don't know, why this is happening!

440
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,990
But I think, I am that man.

441
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,310
That man?

442
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,600
Kang I-an.

443
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,746
Why did it all happen?

444
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,256
Why that man knows me?

445
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,813
And these people, who are they at all?

446
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,120
God damn it!

447
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,517
How did you know, that I was in the church?

448
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,670
Because it was me!

449
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,240
I think, I'm Kang I-an.

450
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,390
What are you saying?

451
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,120
You started all this.

452
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,096
Hyundai, 3882!

453
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,920
If I-an dies,

454
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,190
I can kill you too.

455
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,830
Wait!

456
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,950
Wait!

457
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,600
Hey you!

458
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,426
Shit!

459
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,560
Hey!

460
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,656
I have no time at all.

461
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,947
You have bit different statements.

462
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,420
Do you see that car?

463
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,850
I was driving from there...

464
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,436
Ah...

465
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,596
Ah, I will loose my mind,
what is it do you think?

466
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,780
Don't move.

467
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,530
Move and you're dead.

468
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,036
Do you know Kang I-an?

469
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,796
What?

470
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,560
Tell me about him.

471
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,176
Why is everyone looking for him?

472
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,286
What are you trying to achieve now?

473
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,176
I don't remember anything now.

474
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,290
But I know, that 10mm deeper

475
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,256
and there will be carotid artery
and then you will die.

476
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,352
You know more about Kang I-an,
why do you ask me?

477
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,290
5mm left.

478
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,186
I'm doing only what I'm ordered.

479
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,696
I'm told to catch, then I catch.

480
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,356
To eliminate, then I eliminate.

481
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,086
Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo,

482
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,110
and me now.

483
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,106
Who are these people?

484
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,930
Why the fuck should I know?

485
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,333
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

486
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,446
The cop is coming.

487
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,220
Police, there is police!

488
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,096
When did you see Kang I-an?

489
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,556
When did you see him last time?

490
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,636
When he was escaping with the car
that had an accident.

491
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Don't lie!

492
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,636
There was only man in that car!

493
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,527
I really saw, how he drove off in that car!

494
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,790
Kang I-an was also in that car?

495
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,640
Till 8 o'clock you need to come
with the vehicle documents...

496
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,410
Moon Jin-ah and manager Yoo
came here, however

497
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,070
you just let them go, isn't it?

498
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,910
Curious, what are your trying to achieve?

499
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,520
Nothing.

500
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,220
Nothing?

501
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,090
What then?

502
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,406
Tomorrow they will hand
over the merchandise.

503
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,400
Till that time you
had to deal with everything.

504
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,190
I have a bad feeling.

505
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,947
Why Ji Cheol-ho lost his mind is not clear.

506
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,110
I have no idea why I have
the gun of Kang I-an.

507
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,563
Manager Yoo was strange also.

508
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,260
Everyone around, one by one...

509
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,010
Speak.

510
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,340
As you said, she is here.

511
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,670
What should I do?

512
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,530
Bring her?

513
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,020
Or just kill her right here?

514
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,170
No, watch her,

515
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,480
check where she will go.

516
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,710
They found Moon Jin-ah.

517
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,240
I handed it over to Jeongmo guys.

518
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,410
I can't trust you.

519
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
I'm leaving.

520
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,870
Did you bring it?

521
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,030
So what is it?

522
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,556
They say, that Kang I-an is
involved in some scam.

523
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,190
The mood in the office was just...

524
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,050
At least drink some water first.

525
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,346
List of people with
illegal medical practice.

526
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,314
There are scammers among them
and real doctors.

527
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,380
Some are treating foreigners in need.

528
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,160
Security intelligence service Korea.
Jose Luis.

529
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,310
Prakasi Latry.

530
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,256
Prakasi Latry, 42 years old, Nepal...

531
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Listen,

532
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,040
find him for me.

533
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,340
Is it him?

534
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,017
Are you sure, you
can manage it alone?

535
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,330
I'm begging you.

536
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,336
And give me a car.

537
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,666
Then give me 10k won.

538
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,030
What 10k, I sold you for one!

539
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,700
The price to sell and to buy
is not the same!

540
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,746
But I don't mind exchange rate fluctuation.

541
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,346
Sir.

542
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,246
What are you talking about?

543
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,226
You scared me.

544
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,450
Go, go!

545
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,086
Excuse me, just a moment.

546
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,946
Did you get the recorder
from that car in the morning?

547
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,566
What bullshit are you talking about?
You look like dumbass!

548
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,846
Shit, I'm leaving!

549
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,686
Sir.

550
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,336
I think, it's my car.

551
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,176
I need to find out what happened.

552
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,880
Where is the recorder?

553
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,950
Sir, do you know me?!

554
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,990
It's me, me, hotdog!

555
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,940
Shit, it's something from the other world.

556
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,300
I saw a lot of weird shit in my life

557
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,340
but you know, I see
this for the first time.

558
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,950
No, really.

559
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,143
You are the only one of a kind, right?

560
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
The soul leaves the body

561
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,180
and enters other bodies!

562
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,480
Isn't it?

563
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,563
Then do they have something in common?

564
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,650
So where is it? How far more?

565
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,080
We are here.

566
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,640
Right there.

567
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,190
Hurry up!

568
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,190
How come?
Today everyone lost their mind.

569
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,176
Ah these people.

570
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Shit.

571
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,980
Listen...

572
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,096
I almost died, shit.

573
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,896
Listen,

574
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,276
give me back please
what I've sold you.

575
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,416
That recorder.

576
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,426
You are kidding, right?

577
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,450
Beggar!

578
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,706
Listen,

579
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,776
I don't need the device.

580
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,733
Just give me the memory card.

581
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,420
Beggars, you stink, get lost!

582
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,390
Or pay.

583
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,870
Do you have money?

584
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,280
What are you staring at?

585
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,180
Card is ok?

586
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,870
Yes.

587
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,770
Speak.

588
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,577
Check the place and send the boys.

589
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,198
What an idiot to use a card
when you are wanted?

590
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,390
Sir.

591
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,820
These are memory cards,

592
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,476
that we removed from recorders.

593
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,776
But I don't know which one it is.

594
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,480
You can take them all.

595
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,286
Then can we check them here?

596
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,866
You can do it in that room!

597
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,516
Thank you.

598
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,540
Yeah.

599
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,626
According to recording,
the last person he contacted

600
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,166
is Russian Dima.

601
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,230
First find him.

602
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,316
Have some coffee.

603
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,026
Thank you.

604
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,050
Yes.

605
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Oh!

606
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,670
What?

607
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,310
I think, I found.

608
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,770
Gun! Gun!

609
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,120
What is it?

610
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,110
I think it's him.

611
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,200
Him?

612
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,720
It is me.

613
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,160
Where is he heading to?

614
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,200
Will see now.

615
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,660
Uh.

616
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,356
We are closed already.

617
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,420
Come tomorrow

618
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,920
You are Yoo Joon-Young?

619
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,130
They are...

620
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,800
What should we do?

621
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,490
Come here.

622
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,260
Sir.

623
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,060
Run!

624
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,650
You go that way.

625
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,356
Let me go!

626
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Sir!

627
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,360
Shit!

628
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:23,960
Sir!

629
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,570
Let go, shithead!

630
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:42,890
Hey!

631
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,890
You lost your mind?

632
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,460
Sorry.

633
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,620
What the...

634
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,036
Who are you?

635
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,060
Let me go!

636
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,910
It's on the right side.
What are you doing?

637
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,240
Yes, director Park.

638
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,176
Moon Jin-ah is in the black car.

639
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,800
We are following it.

640
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,733
We are leaving north Hannam bridge.

641
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:55,770
Yes.

642
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
What?

643
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,340
Understood.

644
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,620
We will immediately bring her.

645
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,100
Yes.

646
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,800
Understood.

647
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Hey.

648
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,410
Who are you?

649
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,740
Shit...

650
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,728
Not everything in life
goes the way you want it?

651
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,280
Same for me.

652
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,540
Because of you.

653
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,490
Where were you hiding?

654
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,610
How did you find me?

655
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,010
NOAH MOOLSAN

656
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,210
Noah Moolsan?

657
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,350
Noah Moolsan?

658
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,410
Noah Moolsan...

659
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,130
Why empty handed?

660
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,470
Hmm...

661
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:25,260
You were looking for Moon Jin-ah
and Kang I-an, why are you here?

662
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,400
And where is Park?

663
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,180
He will...

664
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,810
come soon.

665
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,883
Together with Moon Jin-ah.

666
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,830
Come here.

667
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,302
Why are you hiding your eyes,
when I'm talking to you?

668
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,790
Sorry.

669
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,050
Excuse me...

670
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,240
This man...

671
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,270
Who are you?

672
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,700
They were together.

673
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,600
Beggar, I think.

674
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,770
He lost his mind.

675
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,410
Get rid of him.

676
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,400
Why get rid...

677
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,156
I

678
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,726
How could you...

679
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,446
will get rid of him.

680
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,046
do this to a person...

681
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,090
Help!

682
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,510
Mercy!

683
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,546
Mercy!

684
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,570
Get out!

685
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,350
Get out!

686
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,640
Help!

687
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,190
Get out you idiot!

688
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,146
You are done!

689
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:34,906
I need to go...

690
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,940
Get out!

691
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,676
No!

692
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,950
Quiet, please!

693
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,780
This man has changed the body!

694
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,066
He said, he wants to find himself!

695
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,370
On the recorder!

696
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,056
Sir!

697
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,080
Hey!

698
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,670
I told you...

699
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,100
Shut up, beggar!

700
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,526
Do you know something about Noah Moolsan?

701
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,020
Maybe I know it.

702
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,520
Sure, I know it.

703
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,640
I don't know.

704
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,190
You are a bit strange.

705
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,240
Your way of speaking

706
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,426
is really strange.

707
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,970
As if it's not you.

708
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,150
Why is it so many freaks lately?

709
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,980
Right.

710
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,540
Park was right.

711
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,790
He said, something similar happened to me.

712
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,730
And that time

713
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,910
I looked really like you?

714
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,670
What is her name?

715
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Come on.

716
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,770
If you don't remember,
then don't tell.

717
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,860
Soon-Young, what is it?

718
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,630
We had a business here.

719
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,400
Soon-Young.

720
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,960
Soon-Young?

721
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,370
She feels offended now probably.

722
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,000
That you don't even remember
the name of your girlfriend.

723
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,060
Strange.

724
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,560
Very.

725
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,270
But my name is really Soon-Young.

726
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,150
I am Hwang Soon-Young.

727
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,710
Chief will come tomorrow,
now leave the place.

728
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,086
Do you get, what I'm talking about?

729
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,110
Yes.

730
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:07,650
Let's go.

731
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,350
let's go!

732
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,440
Where are you and what are doing?

733
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,580
Sorry.

734
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,460
There was an accident.

735
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,350
What accident?

736
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,580
I will tell everything...

737
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,620
This crazy...

738
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,750
Listen...

739
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,160
He is really crazy...

740
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,260
His body is always changing!

741
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,960
Sir! It's me, hotdog.

742
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,060
You know me.

743
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,990
I'm loosing my mind.

744
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,040
Why are you doing this to me?!

745
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,890
He said,

746
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,360
that Ko Joon-sa

747
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,230
and you are losers.

748
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,590
Dima?

749
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,790
Did you see him?

750
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,500
I have no idea.
I don't speak Korean.

751
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,600
<i>National Intelligence Service.</i>
Passport.

752
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,133
I have no time to deal with you.

753
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,800
But if you want,

754
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,800
I can investigate you.

755
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,930
I heard it is somewhere in Namyangju.

756
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,340
Maybe at some factory.

757
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,130
Where is Kang I-an?

758
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,180
Kang I-an...

759
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,040
I don't know, where he is.

760
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,670
So it is better.

761
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,790
When I escaped,

762
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,030
I decided to come and check,

763
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,350
and he was there.

764
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,320
So and where it that "there"?!

765
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,900
Where?!

766
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,920
Well...

767
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,200
Curious?

768
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,250
Yes.

769
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,510
Kang I-an is my friend.

770
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,950
I know, where he is.

771
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,910
But I will not tell you.

772
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,640
Fucking junkie.

773
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,050
How long will you keep looking?

774
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,730
It is broken.

775
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,836
This is the end.

776
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,396
It's past midnight already.

777
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,136
And the moon is on the right side.

778
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,500
The car is heading south-east.

779
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,200
Highway 66.

780
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,150
Heading south-east on the highway 66.

781
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,270
How do you know all this?

782
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,580
Even if it is so, we can not
search all the highway.

783
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,350
Highway 66?

784
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,920
One moment.

785
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,860
I think I know, where it is.

786
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,206
Hi.

787
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,926
Can you send me the location?

788
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,816
I'm searching, but I didn't
find the exact location yet.

789
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,630
I'm trying, wait.

790
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,500
Pyeongnae-dong, 34-7.

791
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,790
Namyangju, Pyeongnae-dong, 34-7.

792
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,160
Yes, Soon-Jin.

793
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,696
Did you find out?

794
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,750
Yes. In Ulsan. Namyangju, Pyeongnae-dong

795
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,960
Namyangju?

796
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,980
Yes.

797
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,990
Ok, got it, Thank you.

798
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,920
You were on the highway
from Namyangju, right?

799
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:06,950
Sure?

800
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,980
Namyangju...

801
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,140
Namyangju...

802
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:16,446
There is...

803
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,880
a factory in Namyangju, that our
agents used before as a safe house.

804
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,910
Yes?

805
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,136
There was also the
doctor from Nepal, right?

806
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,440
Right, isn't it?

807
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,270
Right.

808
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,436
What do you need?

809
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,460
Excuse me.

810
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,346
On 12th in the night you were
treating a man, who was driving Korando.

811
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,970
Don't know anything.

812
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Move away.

813
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,010
NOAH MOOLSAN

814
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Who are you?

815
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,476
What are you doing here?

816
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,000
Get out of here!

817
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,126
Wait, wait. You didn't get it?
Get out of here!

818
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,880
Yes, yes, thank you...

819
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,880
So loud...

820
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,300
I think it's not here.

821
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,970
Maybe you got it wrong?

822
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,160
It is definitely here.

823
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,790
I can feel it.

824
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,500
Is it him?

825
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:15,930
Yes.

826
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,590
I found my body.

827
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,706
We go in immediately when it's surrounded.

828
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,410
Wait for the order.

829
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,580
I have a bad feeling about it.

830
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,776
It will be fun.

831
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,160
Let's get inside.

832
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,116
Check if merchandise is there.

833
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,736
Put a cordon outside.

834
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,440
Search the area around.

835
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:02,160
End of operation: 5:27.

836
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,730
Let's count.

837
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
Name of deceased: Jae I-myung.

838
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:12,422
Lost merchandise - new drug
from Thailand called "Eterecs".

839
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,706
Unlike other drugs

840
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,126
this one places you in
a near death state of mind,

841
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,746
like you are separated from your body.

842
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,956
Small capsules are getting
in blood stream

843
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,750
and rupture every 12 hours

844
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,706
keeping hallucinations in effect.

845
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,716
Due to high strength of the drug
there are many side effects.

846
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:30,166
Common are hearing hallucinations
and some physical symptoms.

847
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,550
In worst case

848
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,700
you loose memory and then die.

849
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,870
Lost merchandise weighs 3570kg
and costs 25 billion won.

850
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,476
If it will hit the market, it's the end.

851
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,033
I need to talk. Come out for a moment.

852
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,200
Kang I-an!

853
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,310
Yes.

854
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,966
You still didn't find the
location of Yoo Joon-Youngа?

855
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:49,300
No, not yet.

856
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,076
He is definitely connected
to the events today.

857
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,396
If you will get any info about him
immediately report to me.

858
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,220
Report about all movements.

859
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,490
How many times did we find
bodies instead of drugs?

860
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,456
If we will not deal with it,

861
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,976
we will have to ask for
help from the police.

862
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,546
Let's not disgrace ourselves.

863
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,610
Yeah.

864
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:11,490
Where were you hiding all this time?

865
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,997
Some place here, some place there.

866
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:21,190
Why do you have my lighter?

867
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,310
Why was it at the crime scene?

868
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:25,876
Inside the organization

869
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,166
there are some, who kill the
drug dealers and lay their hands on drugs.

870
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,606
Is it not because you leaked the information?

871
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,360
They forged the evidence.

872
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,856
I investigated that,

873
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,766
that's why they pinned that to me

874
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:36,596
and they are looking for me now.

875
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,870
Cut the crap.

876
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,390
Turn yourself in.

877
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,540
Get your hand out.

878
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,940
Trust me.

879
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,150
Get your hand out, I said!

880
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,430
Check it.

881
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,160
Did you call Park?

882
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,696
I said, you are turning yourself in.

883
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,970
Do not resist.

884
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,540
Make sure to check it.

885
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,720
It's cold.

886
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,510
Did you wait long?

887
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,353
Sorry, I had some urgent things to do.

888
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,366
So if I'm here,
should I come in and confess?

889
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,160
Confess what?

890
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,910
Confess at home.

891
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,540
Seoul has a great night view.

892
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,350
Yes, indeed.

893
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,280
What is it?

894
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,740
What happened?

895
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,930
Joon-Young...

896
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,870
Manager Yoo?

897
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,210
Yes.

898
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:02,996
He is wanted since last week,
he leaked all inside information.

899
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,020
What?

900
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:07,316
I've though a lot about it,
but I reported him.

901
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,860
Not a nice feeling.

902
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,260
So that's why

903
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,560
you were so down?

904
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,436
And what to do now?

905
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,993
Call from head office.
Probably urgent.

906
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,740
Let's talk at home.

907
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,446
They say some cops lay
their hands on drugs.

908
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,106
Are you them?

909
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:31,526
Yes.

910
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,990
We are those cops.

911
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,730
Leave what you have and get off.

912
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,790
Nothing to say?

913
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,620
If you leave quietly,
nobody will get hurt.

914
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,450
It's your choice.

915
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,016
Hey, shit!

916
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:46,956
What the...?

917
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,436
Where are you going? What is it?

918
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,760
Jin-ah.

919
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,790
Who are you?

920
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,916
Hey!

921
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,940
Shit!

922
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,570
Where are you?

923
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,900
And where are you?

924
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,240
Chief Park?

925
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,356
Jin-ah!

926
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,106
I-an!

927
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,130
Jin-ah!

928
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,860
Jin-ah!

929
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:16,616
I-an!

930
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,640
Stop it.

931
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,100
Jin-ah!

932
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,790
He must be calmed down.

933
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,020
I-an!

934
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,736
I-an!

935
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,416
I will kill you, bastards!

936
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,910
I-an!

937
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,160
I-an!

938
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,290
No!

939
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,086
Stop!

940
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,580
No! No!

941
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,730
I-an...

942
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,350
I-an!

943
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,890
I-an!

944
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:32,976
No!

945
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,490
That's Eterecs.

946
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,467
You can't buy a dose for your salary.

947
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,677
How do you find "near death experience"?

948
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,240
Why are you doing this...

949
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:45,150
Lost your mind?

950
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,440
Where is it?

951
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,710
Why did you get involved in this?

952
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,690
Ah!

953
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,260
No, no.

954
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,410
You started it right?

955
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,470
You killed these two.

956
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,700
And killed yourself.

957
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:29,140
Good story?

958
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,590
And the scene...

959
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,890
Think of it yourself.

960
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,160
Jin-ah...

961
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,760
I-an...

962
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,550
I-an...

963
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,620
I-an!

964
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,640
Jin-ah!

965
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:57,130
I-an!

966
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,520
Jin-ah...

967
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,660
Jin-ah...

968
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,310
I-an...

969
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,510
I love you...

970
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,460
Jin-ah! Are you ok?

971
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,780
I-an!

972
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,046
Jin-ah!

973
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,260
What is it?

974
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,670
This...

975
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,180
What is it?

976
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,030
Jin-ah!

977
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
Let go!

978
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
I-an!

979
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,220
No time!

980
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,220
Hey, hey, hey!

981
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,460
Latry!

982
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,116
How is that?!

983
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,056
Hey, guys!

984
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,320
Help! Hurry!

985
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:19,486
Hurry!

986
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:20,510
Hurry!

987
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,200
Jin-ah...

988
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:01,890
Found.

989
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,853
Adjacent building, 4th floor.

990
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,010
What are you doing here?

991
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:10,870
What are you doing?

992
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,230
I was thinking,

993
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,200
what really happened to me.

994
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,360
What?

995
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,830
And I figured out,

996
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:29,840
what I have to do now.

997
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:41,286
You asked, what do they have in common?

998
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,360
Me?

999
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,510
They were there that day.

1000
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,690
I'm transferring into them.

1001
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:48,516
So..

1002
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,340
...you remember everything?

1003
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:51,766
Jin-ah

1004
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:54,416
I-an, where are you? Call me.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid. Call me.

1005
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,830
What should I do?

1006
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:59,020
We are surrounded outside
by guys with guns!

1007
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,916
They are here because of you?

1008
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,566
Me?

1009
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,570
I?..Me?..

1010
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:04,960
Leave, hurry.

1011
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,656
I don't need a massacre here!

1012
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,470
Get out of here now!

1013
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,960
Listen.

1014
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,280
Sorry,

1015
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,420
but take care of this.

1016
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,087
Take care... take care of what?

1017
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,980
Is it her Park was talking about?

1018
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,530
Chief?

1019
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,190
Are you ok?

1020
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,563
There are armed people there!

1021
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,890
It seems...

1022
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,736
I-An is also somewhere near.

1023
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,910
Got it.

1024
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,530
Wait in the car.

1025
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,670
Chief Lee!

1026
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,730
Chief!

1027
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,870
I don't...

1028
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,570
What are you going to do?

1029
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,697
Do you know how much is that deal?

1030
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,923
Do you want to spoil everything?

1031
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:15,730
Chief Lee...

1032
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,176
The police will arrive soon,
so let's finish fast.

1033
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,700
No!

1034
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,440
What the...?

1035
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,640
Drive!

1036
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,770
Get out!

1037
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,090
Stop!

1038
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:04,220
Flight 8700...

1039
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,210
Still taking drugs?

1040
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,480
No peace with you, not at all!

1041
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:39,010
How many did you kill already,
God damn it?

1042
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:44,520
I told you, not to handle
Kang I-an like that.

1043
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,807
You wanted so much to do it your way?

1044
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,160
Hired some junkie.

1045
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,826
You want to get my place?

1046
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,106
I will deal with everything.

1047
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,376
I've dealt with everything till now.

1048
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,756
I caught Moon Jin-ah.

1049
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,046
And manager Yoo.

1050
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,330
And later...
caught Kang I-an too.

1051
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,046
Ah, no, didn't catch yet...
but soon I will!

1052
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,750
Do I need something else?

1053
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,190
Ah?

1054
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,956
What are you so afraid of,

1055
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,113
why are you screwing me, shit...

1056
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:28,416
You saw her in the church,
why did you let her go?

1057
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,440
Ah?

1058
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,680
What are you going to do?

1059
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,790
Ou-ou.

1060
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,440
You we sent again to follow me?

1061
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,490
It seems so. And you are so busy.

1062
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,680
Hey, did we meet in the church?

1063
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:48,870
She said no.

1064
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,670
You are always the good one.

1065
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,060
Ah?

1066
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,456
You picked me first,

1067
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,160
said, I was brilliant.

1068
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,216
What?

1069
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,600
What again? What?

1070
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,300
Ah?

1071
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,426
Ah you shithead...

1072
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,130
What are you staring at?

1073
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,060
Joon-Young!

1074
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:45,650
Joon-Young!

1075
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:47,200
Joon-Young!

1076
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,680
Joon-Young...

1077
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,413
They all were there that day.

1078
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,410
I'm transferring into them.

1079
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,430
Park, get up!

1080
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,560
Wake up!

1081
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,576
What are you doing?

1082
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,970
Calm down.

1083
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,200
We must get out of here.

1084
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,280
Ah, shit!

1085
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,110
It's you, chief Chung!

1086
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:46,930
Who are you?

1087
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,470
What about Lee?

1088
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,760
Well,

1089
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,140
he is sick.

1090
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,430
Getting rest.

1091
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,550
Getting rest?

1092
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,580
He is strange lately.

1093
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,706
Well, it always like this with people.

1094
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:00,350
They are strange.

1095
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:17,910
Enough?

1096
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,930
Bring the merchandise.

1097
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:22,210
Yes.

1098
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,366
You said, you tested it?

1099
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,390
Of course.

1100
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,300
Thoroughly tested.

1101
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,000
Park, what is it?

1102
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,170
Where is Jin-ah?

1103
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,070
You motherfucker!

1104
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,036
What was it?

1105
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,860
Hey, what is that gunshot?

1106
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,856
Check it.

1107
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,826
What's wrong?

1108
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:25,996
You want to set me up?

1109
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:28,110
No, not really!

1110
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,550
This is Park.

1111
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,040
Park?

1112
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,316
Hey!

1113
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,986
He is not working for you?

1114
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:51,066
That bustard...

1115
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,176
What are you waiting for?

1116
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,200
Kill him.

1117
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,706
Bastard.

1118
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,650
Rat! Sitting here.

1119
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:00,660
Move!

1120
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,620
Fucking looser!

1121
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:05,690
Made some shit behind my back?

1122
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:10,202
You piss me off.
Can't even clean it up, idiot...

1123
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:14,250
What are you staring at!

1124
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,580
Be quiet.

1125
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:20,350
I can't concentrate!

1126
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:31,510
What do you want from me,
fucking idiots?

1127
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,430
Ah?

1128
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:46,020
He is nuts.

1129
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:48,716
If you stayed alive,
you better run away.

1130
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,856
Did you come here to make a mess?

1131
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,880
Ah?

1132
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,900
Ah?

1133
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,750
What is that?

1134
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:39,270
Why are you here?

1135
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:40,690
Come here.

1136
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,660
There is something interesting here.

1137
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:43,810
Where is Jin-ah

1138
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,800
Where is Jin-ah?!

1139
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,470
Have you lost your mind?

1140
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,200
Hey!

1141
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,127
How do you want to deal with that?

1142
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:16,753
You got your revenge already.

1143
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,660
Stop it.

1144
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,580
You are Park?

1145
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,840
Not Park, right?

1146
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,100
Drop the gun and come out.

1147
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,380
If you don't want her
to die come out!

1148
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:50,430
Won't come out?

1149
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,060
I will shoot her.

1150
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,520
Ah?

1151
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,470
You don't care, right?

1152
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:57,610
I will shoot.

1153
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,680
Don't do it.

1154
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,510
Ok?

1155
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,600
Don't torture her anymore.

1156
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,110
You,

1157
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:21,340
who are you?

1158
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:26,710
And how do you think?

1159
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:32,300
You?

1160
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:34,330
You...

1161
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,530
You...

1162
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,360
Don't know, it's hard.

1163
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,266
Kang I-an?

1164
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,156
Park?

1165
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,913
Are you a ghost, shithead?

1166
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,350
Ghost, right?

1167
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:41,790
Ah, ghost?

1168
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,430
Now I got it.

1169
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,367
Ghost or whatever it is you are...

1170
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,367
The main thing is the story.

1171
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:37,490
The story now will be

1172
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,860
that you lost your mind,

1173
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:42,490
took drugs and assaulted me.

1174
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,410
Are you kidding?

1175
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,020
Playing with me?

1176
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:57,140
Fuck...

1177
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,290
I-an?

1178
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,900
I-an, right?

1179
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:50,230
Did you wait long?

1180
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:55,870
Sorry.

1181
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:02,150
I had an urgent business.

1182
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,620
I have to

1183
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,390
confess...

1184
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,200
I-an!

1185
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:37,610
Wait...

1186
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,500
Wait!

1187
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,070
I-an!

1188
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:55,790
I-an!

1189
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:59,700
I-an!

1190
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,530
I-an!

1191
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:32,490
USB flash stick

1192
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:37,360
we gave to specialists of KAIST,
but small chance to recover.

1193
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:41,382
And it is not clear,
when Kang I-an will be conscious.

1194
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,240
But I want to ask you.

1195
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,990
Here.

1196
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:52,540
Why all of them

1197
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:55,240
were so eager to save you?

1198
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,550
I just can't understand it.

1199
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,240
It is not them.

1200
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,750
It is one man.

1201
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,100
SPIRITWALKER
